# secrets-app
This is a simple MERN Secret app that allows users to create, edit, view details and delete a Secret. So far it is not available the user login to handle users secrets as I am still working on that.

Â¿How did I create?
This app was created using React to design the frontend and behaviors.
The backend was created using Node JS and Express as a framework. I have created 2 restfull API's to handle different actions to a secret:
1) Create a secret.
2) Secret details.
3) Edit secret.
4) Delete secret.

To store the secrets, I used a MongoDB that connects to my server.
